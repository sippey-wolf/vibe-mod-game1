# The Cold Case of Eleanor Ash - Gameplay Design Analysis

## Story Arc Analysis

### Three-Act Structure
**Act I: Discovery** (Level 1 - Torn Photo)
- Evidence: Hidden relationship revealed
- Emotional beat: Confusion → Suspicion
- Question raised: Who was this man?

**Act II: Threat** (Level 2 - Shredded Letter) 
- Evidence: Fear and intimidation revealed
- Emotional beat: Suspicion → Concern
- Question raised: What was "D" threatening her with?

**Act III: Truth** (Level 3 - Crime Scene)
- Evidence: Murder staging revealed
- Emotional beat: Concern → Certainty
- Resolution: Official story completely debunked

### Key Evidence Pieces
1. **Photo Fragment**: Proves Eleanor wasn't isolated/alone
2. **Threatening Letter**: Establishes motive and perpetrator initial
3. **Scene Reconstruction**: Proves murder, not suicide

## Level Design Philosophy

### Core Mechanics Integration
Each Sokoban level should:
- **Mechanically represent the evidence type** (fragments, strips, spatial arrangement)
- **Increase in complexity** to mirror the investigation's deepening
- **Include red herrings** that reflect real detective work
- **Reward careful observation** over brute force solving

### Visual Storytelling Through Gameplay
- **Environmental details** tell story even before puzzle solving
- **Object placement** hints at narrative significance
- **Lighting and atmosphere** guide emotional pacing
- **Interactive elements** reveal character through investigation style

## Progressive Difficulty Curve

### Level 1 (5x5): Introduction
- **Complexity**: Simple reconstruction
- **Mechanics**: Basic push-to-position
- **Story weight**: Personal/intimate revelation

### Level 2 (6x6): Escalation  
- **Complexity**: Sequential ordering required
- **Mechanics**: Linear arrangement with decoy pieces
- **Story weight**: Threat/danger revelation

### Level 3 (8x8): Climax

- **Mechanics**: Multi-object coordination
- **Story weight**: Complete narrative reversal

## Emotional Pacing Strategy
- **Level 1**: Curiosity and discovery
