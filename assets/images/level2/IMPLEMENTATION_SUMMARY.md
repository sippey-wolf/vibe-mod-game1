- **Fragment Breakdown**: 7 main pieces + 1 decoy with detailed descriptions
- **Technical Requirements**: Resolution, format, and quality standards
- **Narrative Impact**: Progressive revelation strategy for maximum emotional effect

### 3. AI Generation Prompts ✓
- **Master Prompt**: Complete threatening letter generation
- **Individual Fragment Prompts**: Specific prompts for each piece
- **Environment Prompts**: Evidence room, desk, light table, and props
- **Style Variations**: Alternative approaches for different AI generators
- **Technical Parameters**: Recommended settings and quality enhancers

### 4. Integration Plan ✓
- **AssetManager Updates**: Code specifications for loading Level 2 assets
- **Level2.js Implementation**: Complete class structure and game mechanics

- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive validation approach

## Key Visual Elements

### The Complete Threatening Letter
- **Content**: "Eleanor, If you come near me again, I'll go to the police. You don't control me anymore. I'm done being afraid of you. Stay away from my family. Stay away from my life. This is your final warning. - D"
- **Style**: Masculine handwriting with aggressive strokes, fountain pen ink
- **Paper**: Aged cream paper with authentic 1940s appearance
- **Evidence Value**: Proves Eleanor was being threatened, contradicts suicide theory

### The Seven Letter Fragments
1. **Fragment A**: "If you come near me" (establishes threat)
2. **Fragment B**: "again, I'll go to" (escalation)
3. **Fragment C**: "the police. You don't" (authority involvement)
4. **Fragment D**: "control me anymore." (power struggle revelation)
5. **Fragment E**: "I'm done being" (defiance declaration)
6. **Fragment F**: "afraid of you." (emotional revelation)
7. **Fragment G**: "- D" signature (connects to Level 1 mystery man)

### Environment Assets
- **Evidence Storage Room**: Cold institutional setting with metal shelving
- **Light Table**: Professional examination surface with glow effects
- **Wooden Desk**: Worn detective workspace with authentic aging
- **Supporting Props**: Wastebasket, magnifying glass, evidence boxes

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Asset Generation
1. **Use AI Prompts**: Generate images using provided prompts
2. **Quality Check**: Ensure noir aesthetic and period accuracy
3. **Fragment Creation**: Create torn pieces that fit together logically
4. **File Organization**: Place assets in proper directory structure

### Phase 2: Code Integration
1. **Switch to Code Mode**: Implement JavaScript changes
2. **Update AssetManager**: Add Level 2 asset loading
3. **Create Level2.js**: Implement complete level class
4. **Add Mechanics**: Letter reconstruction and win conditions

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish
1. **Visual Testing**: Verify fragment visibility and alignment
2. **Performance Testing**: Check loading times and memory usage
3. **Gameplay Testing**: Ensure puzzle mechanics work with images
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify fallbacks and high contrast support

## Ready-to-Use AI Prompts

### Master Prompt (Copy & Paste Ready)
```
A 1940s threatening letter written on aged cream paper with dark blue-black fountain pen ink. The letter reads: "Eleanor, If you come near me again, I'll go to the police. You don't control me anymore. I'm done being afraid of you. Stay away from my family. Stay away from my life. This is your final warning. - D". Masculine handwriting with aggressive, forceful strokes showing anger and pressure variations. Paper is slightly yellowed with age, minor stains, authentic vintage appearance. High contrast noir lighting, dramatic shadows, film grain texture.
