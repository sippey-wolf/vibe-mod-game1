## Fragment-Specific Generation Strategy

### Step 1: Generate Complete Letter
1. Use master prompt to create full threatening letter
2. Ensure handwriting appears masculine and aggressive
3. Verify noir lighting and period accuracy
4. Check that text is clearly readable
5. Confirm paper aging appears authentic

### Step 2: Create Fragment Division Plan
1. Mark tear lines on complete letter image
2. Ensure fragments will fit together logically
3. Plan overlap areas for puzzle mechanics
4. Consider gameplay visibility requirements
5. Account for 6x6 grid constraints

### Step 3: Generate Individual Fragments
1. Use fragment-specific prompts
2. Maintain handwriting consistency with master letter
3. Add realistic torn edge effects
4. Apply appropriate aging to each piece
5. Ensure text remains readable on fragments

### Step 4: Generate Environment Assets
1. Create evidence room background first
2. Generate desk surface with proper wear
3. Add light table with appropriate glow
4. Create supporting props (wastebasket, magnifying glass)
5. Ensure lighting consistency across all assets

## Post-Generation Processing

### Required Edits
1. **Torn Edges**: Add realistic paper tear textures and fiber details
2. **Aging Effects**: Apply consistent vintage patina across all paper
3. **Fragment Fitting**: Ensure pieces align perfectly when assembled
4. **Size Optimization**: Scale appropriately for 6x6 game grid
5. **Transparency**: Add alpha channel for clean torn edges
6. **Text Clarity**: Ensure all text remains readable at game resolution

### Quality Checklist

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start with Complete Letter**: Generate the full threatening letter first
2. **Verify Content and Style**: Ensure handwriting appears appropriately threatening
3. **Create Fragment Plan**: Map out how letter will be divided
4. **Generate Fragments**: Use individual prompts maintaining consistency
5. **Create Environment**: Generate background and prop assets
6. **Apply Post-Processing**: Add final aging, transparency, and optimization
7. **Test Assembly**: Verify fragments fit together correctly
8. **Integrate with Game**: Test visibility and impact in game context

## Expected Emotional Journey

When players reconstruct the letter:
1. **Fragments A-C**: "This is a threatening letter to Eleanor"
2. **Fragments D-E**: "Someone was trying to control Eleanor"
3. **Fragment F**: "Eleanor was afraid of this person"
4. **Fragment G**: "The mysterious 'D' from Level 1 was threatening Eleanor"
5. **Complete Letter**: "Eleanor wasn't suicidal - she was being stalked and threatened"

The complete reconstruction should deliver the narrative revelation: Eleanor was being threatened by "D" (possibly the man from the photograph), establishing clear motive for murder and completely contradicting the suicide ruling.

## Integration with Level 1

### Visual Continuity
- Maintain consistent noir aesthetic from Level 1
- Use similar aging and lighting techniques
- Ensure "D" signature connects to mysterious man theme

### Narrative Progression
- Build on Level 1's revelation of Eleanor's secret relationship
- Establish that the relationship turned threatening
- Set up Level 3's crime scene investigation
- Create compelling mystery around "D's" identity
