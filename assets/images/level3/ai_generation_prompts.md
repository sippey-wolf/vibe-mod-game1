## Fragment-Specific Generation Strategy

### Step 1: Generate Complete Crime Scene
1. Use master prompts to create both staged and true scenes
2. Ensure 1940s period accuracy in all furnishings
3. Verify noir lighting and dramatic shadows
4. Check that evidence contradictions are visually clear
5. Confirm 8x8 grid layout compatibility

### Step 2: Create Evidence Object Variations
1. Generate each evidence object in both states (staged/true)
2. Maintain lighting consistency with master scenes
3. Ensure objects fit 56x56 pixel grid cells
4. Add realistic aging and crime scene wear
5. Verify visual contradictions are obvious

### Step 3: Generate Static Furniture
1. Create immovable furniture pieces first
2. Ensure period accuracy and noir aesthetic
3. Add appropriate crime scene disturbance
4. Maintain lighting consistency
5. Size appropriately for grid system

### Step 4: Generate Atmospheric Elements
1. Create lighting and shadow overlays
2. Generate investigation tools and markers
3. Add dust, tape, and environmental details
4. Ensure all elements support noir atmosphere
5. Test overlay compatibility with base scenes

## Post-Generation Processing

### Required Edits
1. **Transparency**: Add alpha channels for moveable objects
2. **Grid Alignment**: Ensure objects fit 56x56 pixel cells perfectly
3. **Lighting Consistency**: Match all objects to scene lighting
4. **Evidence Clarity**: Enhance visual contradictions between states
5. **Size Optimization**: Scale appropriately for 8x8 grid system
6. **Animation Prep**: Create smooth transitions between states

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start with Master Scenes**: Generate both staged and true crime scenes first
2. **Verify Period Accuracy**: Ensure all elements are authentically 1940s
3. **Create Evidence Objects**: Generate each object in both states
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Use similar lighting and style parameters
5. **Test Contradictions**: Verify visual differences are obvious
6. **Apply Post-Processing**: Add transparency, sizing, and optimization
7. **Test Grid Compatibility**: Ensure objects fit 8x8 grid system
8. **Integrate with Game**: Test visibility and impact in game context

## Expected Emotional Journey

When players reconstruct the crime scene:
1. **Initial Scene**: "This looks like a clear suicide case"
2. **First Contradictions**: "Wait, something doesn't add up here"
3. **Evidence Repositioning**: "The chair should be by the door, not the window"
4. **Blood Pattern Revelation**: "The blood spatter is all wrong for suicide"
5. **Gun Position Discovery**: "The gun was placed in the wrong hand"
6. **Window Evidence**: "The killer escaped through the window"
7. **Complete Reconstruction**: "This was murder, carefully staged as suicide"
8. **Final Revelation**: "D from the letter killed Eleanor and covered it up"

The complete reconstruction should deliver the narrative climax: Eleanor was murdered by "D" (the man from Level 1's photo), who then carefully staged the scene to look like suicide, but left enough evidence for a determined detective to uncover the truth.

## Integration with Previous Levels

### Visual Continuity
- Maintain consistent noir aesthetic from Levels 1 & 2
- Use similar aging and lighting techniques
- Ensure "D" connection is visually reinforced
- Connect mystery man from photo to crime scene evidence

### Narrative Progression
- Build on Level 1's revelation of Eleanor's secret relationship
- Connect to Level 2's threatening letter from "D"
- Provide definitive proof that "D" murdered Eleanor
- Complete the evidence chain: Photo → Letter → Crime Scene → Murder Conviction
