### Key Technical Decisions

**Canvas vs DOM**:
- **Recommendation**: HTML5 Canvas for pixel-perfect control
- **Benefits**: Smooth animations, consistent rendering, performance
- **Considerations**: Requires custom accessibility implementation

**State Management**:
- **Recommendation**: Simple state machine pattern
- **States**: Loading → Narrative → Puzzle → Transition → Complete
- **Benefits**: Clear flow control, easy debugging

**Asset Strategy**:
- **Recommendation**: Preload all assets during opening narrative
- **Format**: PNG sprites, WebP backgrounds where supported
- **Optimization**: Sprite sheets for animations, compressed audio

## Art Asset Specifications

### Sprite Requirements
**Level 1 Assets**:
- 5 photo fragment sprites (64x64px each)
- Apartment furniture sprites (chair, books, lamp)
- Detective character sprite with movement animations
- Particle effects for photo completion

**Level 2 Assets**:
- 7 letter strip sprites with handwritten text
- 3 decoy strip sprites
- Evidence room props (boxes, shelves, light table)
- Fluorescent lighting effects

**Level 3 Assets**:
- Crime scene furniture sprites (bed, dresser, nightstand)
- Evidence markers and chalk outline graphics
- Blood spatter and forensic detail sprites
- Before/after comparison overlay graphics

### Background Art
- **Resolution**: 2048x1152 minimum (scales down for smaller screens)
- **Style**: Consistent pixel art with noir color palettes
- **Layers**: Separate background, midground, and lighting layers
- **Format**: High-quality PNG with transparency support

### UI Elements
- **Detective Theme**: Case file folders, evidence tags, police tape
- **Typography**: Typewriter font for narrative, clean sans-serif for UI
- **Icons**: Magnifying glass, evidence markers, case file symbols
- **Accessibility**: High contrast alternatives for all visual elements

## Audio Design Recommendations

### Sound Effects
**Environmental Audio**:
- Level 1: Warm apartment ambiance (clock ticking, distant traffic)
- Level 2: Cold institutional sounds (fluorescent hum, ventilation)
- Level 3: Eerie crime scene atmosphere (wind, settling house)

**Interaction Sounds**:
- Object movement: Material-appropriate sounds (paper, wood, metal)
- Correct placement: Satisfying confirmation tones
- Completion: Dramatic revelation stingers
- UI interactions: Subtle detective-themed sounds

### Music Strategy
- **Minimal Approach**: Atmospheric soundscapes rather than melodic music
- **Dynamic Audio**: Intensity changes based on puzzle progress
- **Emotional Pacing**: Supports narrative beats without overwhelming
- **Accessibility**: Visual indicators for all audio cues

## Accessibility Implementation Plan

### Visual Accessibility
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for low vision users
- **Colorblind Support**: Pattern and texture alternatives to color coding
- **Text Scaling**: Adjustable font sizes for all narrative text
- **Motion Sensitivity**: Reduced animation options

### Motor Accessibility
- **Alternative Controls**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **Click Alternatives**: Drag-and-drop or click-to-move options
- **Timing Flexibility**: No time pressure, pausable at any point
- **Precision Assistance**: Larger hit targets, snap-to-grid assistance

### Cognitive Accessibility
- **Progressive Hints**: Contextual help without spoiling solutions
- **Clear Objectives**: Always-visible goals and current progress
- **Save Anywhere**: Resume progress at any point in any level
- **Difficulty Options**: Multiple complexity levels for each puzzle

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Loading Optimization
- **Asset Preloading**: Load next level assets during current level play
- **Progressive Loading**: Critical assets first, atmospheric details second
- **Compression**: Optimized sprites and audio for web delivery
- **Caching**: Browser cache strategy for repeat visits

### Runtime Optimization
- **Dirty Rectangle Rendering**: Only redraw changed canvas areas
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse sprite objects to reduce garbage collection
- **Event Throttling**: Limit input processing to 60fps
- **Memory Management**: Clean up unused assets between levels

### Mobile Optimization
- **Touch Controls**: Finger-friendly interaction areas
- **Responsive Design**: Scales appropriately on all screen sizes
- **Battery Efficiency**: Optimized rendering to preserve battery life
- **Network Awareness**: Graceful handling of slow connections

## Launch Strategy Recommendations

### Pre-Launch Testing
1. **Internal Testing**: Complete gameplay flow validation
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
3. **Device Testing**: Multiple browsers, mobile devices, tablets
4. **User Testing**: First-time player experience validation

### Launch Preparation
- **Analytics Integration**: Track player progress and completion rates
- **Error Reporting**: Automatic bug reporting for post-launch fixes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
- **Feedback Collection**: In-game feedback system for improvements

### Post-Launch Support
- **Bug Fix Pipeline**: Rapid response to critical issues
- **Content Updates**: Potential additional cases or difficulty modes
- **Community Engagement**: Player feedback integration
- **Platform Expansion**: Potential mobile app or Steam release

## Success Metrics & KPIs

- **Puzzle Efficiency**: Average moves per level completion

### Technical Performance
- **Load Times**: Asset loading and level transition speeds
- **Frame Rate**: Consistent 60fps performance across devices
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of technical issues or crashes
- **Accessibility Usage**: Adoption of accessibility features

### Narrative Impact
