# Crime Scene Reenactment - Visual Asset Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document provides a complete implementation plan for creating visual assets for Level 3 of "The Cold Case of Eleanor Ash" detective game. The level centers around reconstructing Eleanor's apartment crime scene to prove her death was murder, not suicide, serving as the climactic revelation that brings justice to Eleanor's case.

## What We've Created

### 1. Asset Directory Structure ✓

- **Documentation**: Complete README with technical specifications and narrative purpose
- **Consistency**: Follows successful Level 1 and Level 2 patterns

### 2. Detailed Visual Specifications ✓
- **Crime Scene Backgrounds**: Staged vs. actual murder scene versions
- **Evidence Objects**: 6 primary evidence pieces with dual states (staged/truth)
- **Static Furniture**: Period-accurate 1940s apartment furnishings
- **Atmospheric Elements**: Lighting, shadows, investigation tools
- **Technical Requirements**: 8x8 grid system with 56x56 pixel cells

### 3. Comprehensive AI Generation Prompts ✓

## Key Visual Elements

### The Crime Scene Environment
- **Eleanor's Apartment**: Authentic 1940s bedroom/sitting area with period furniture
- **Dual States**: Staged suicide scene vs. actual murder scene reconstruction
- **Atmosphere**: Clinical, haunting crime scene with harsh institutional lighting
- **Color Palette**: Noir grays and browns with red evidence highlights
- **Grid System**: 8x8 layout (448x392 pixels) for complex evidence positioning

### The Six Evidence Objects

#### 1. Chair Evidence
- **Staged**: Knocked over near window (fake accident)
- **Truth**: Positioned near door (Eleanor's escape attempt)
- **Revelation**: Proves Eleanor tried to flee, wasn't suicidal

#### 2. Gun Evidence
- **Staged**: Placed in Eleanor's non-dominant hand
- **Truth**: Dropped by attacker after struggle
- **Revelation**: Gun placement proves murder, not suicide

#### 3. Blood Evidence
- **Staged**: Small pool near window (suicide location)
- **Truth**: Spatter pattern near door (actual struggle location)
- **Revelation**: Blood evidence contradicts official story

#### 4. Body Outline Evidence
- **Staged**: Chalk outline in suicide position
- **Truth**: Outline showing defensive wounds and struggle
- **Revelation**: Body position impossible for suicide

#### 5. Window Evidence
- **Staged**: Closed window (no jump attempt)
- **Truth**: Open window (killer's escape route)
- **Revelation**: Window reveals how killer escaped

#### 6. Lamp Evidence
- **Staged**: Positioned as if knocked over by falling body
- **Truth**: Broken during actual struggle
- **Revelation**: Lamp damage shows violent struggle occurred

## Ready-to-Use AI Prompts

### Master Prompt - Staged Scene (Copy & Paste Ready)
```
A 1940s apartment bedroom crime scene with noir lighting, showing Eleanor Ash's staged suicide scene. Dark oak furniture including bed, nightstand, dresser, and bookshelf. Overturned wooden chair near window, revolver on floor, chalk body outline, police evidence markers. Harsh institutional lighting creating dramatic shadows, cold blue-gray color palette with muted browns. Crime scene tape, scattered investigation tools, clinical forensic atmosphere. High contrast black and white with selective color highlights for evidence. Aged, weathered appearance suggesting decades-old cold case.
```

### Master Prompt - Truth Scene (Copy & Paste Ready)
```
Same 1940s apartment bedroom but showing actual murder scene reconstruction. Chair positioned near door showing escape attempt, blood spatter patterns indicating struggle, evidence of fight and cover-up. Window partially open revealing escape route, broken lamp from struggle, disturbed furniture. Dramatic noir lighting with deep shadows, film grain texture, authentic crime scene photography aesthetic. Evidence markers repositioned to show true sequence of events.
